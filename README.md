# dice-game
it is a dice game challenge using JavaScript for learning practices 

        Gayheart's contribution to the mini dice game project :
        github/Gayheart2506.com

Instead of clicking the refresh button to refresh the page for a different outcome in the dice toss, 
i have created a toss button which when clicked on refreshed the whole page for a different outcome in the dice. 

                                ENJOY  !!!
